# Transformers-for-Multi-omics-Integration

The field of omics has revolutionized our understanding of disease by unveiling molecular intricacies. Integrating omics data is crucial for a holistic view of disease mechanisms. Deep learning models, particularly Transformers, are pivotal for analyzing complex omics datasets. They learn patterns and relationships, aiding in predictive analysis and uncovering biological insights. Multi-omics integration coupled with deep learning enables comprehensive understanding and predictive modeling for disease diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we discuss the suitability of Transformers in integrating multi-omics data, focusing on their application in plant biology. Specifically, we explore three Transformer-based fusion architectures for integrating multi-omics data from two wild peanut species: early fusion, late fusion, and hierarchical fusion, treating each speciesâ€™ omics data as separate modalities. These architectures are modeled as unsupervised due to label unavailability, with evaluation based on reconstruction error, predictive variance disparity, and Silhouette score to determine the most effective model.
